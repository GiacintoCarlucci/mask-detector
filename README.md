## General info
This is a simple machine learning project to learn the basics of tensorflow.js, ml5.js, p5.js and how to combine them to make predictions based on a trained model.

The model is trained with [Google Teacheable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) using a selection of a larger dataset with:
- 256 images of portraits of people with masks
- 256 portraits of people without masks

you can check the online **demo on [my website](https://www.giacintocarlucci.it/mask-detector/)**
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
  * tensorflow.js
  * ml5.js
  * p5.js
	  
## Launch
You just need to run a localhost server in the root directory of the project.
It can be done using python:
`python3 -m http.server`

Then a localhost server will be run at localhost:8000 in your browser.

## Example of use
Will provide images and examples asap.
